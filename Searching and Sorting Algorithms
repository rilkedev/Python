Binary Search: 
-------------
  > Linear Search runs in O(n) time; however, Binary Search runs in constant [O(1)] time. Binary search is only applicable if a list is sorted. 
  >>  Algorithmic Steps for Binary Search:
      * Variable "first" set to hold the index of the beginning of the list, 0 
      * Variable "last" set to hold the index of the last index of the list; the index at the last position will be the length of the list 
        minus one: len(list)-1 
      *While-loop condition set to first <= last 
      *Variable "middle" set to hold the index responsible for the middle element of the list. This will be set to the addition of the first and last index added,
       then dividing that by 2 (floor division): mid = (first + last)//2 
      *if target equals list[mid], then return the index at which that occurs (mid)
      *otherwise (elif), if the list[mid] is less than the target - meaning that the target is greater than the item at the midpoint, discard searching 
       all elements to the left of the midpoint. Position your "first" pointer to the index immediately following the midpoint: first = midpoint + 1. 
       We opt for first to hold midpoint + 1 because we know that the item at the midpoint does not equal the target given that if this were the case, then our
       previous condition [if list[midpoint] == target] would be true, and we'd have returned the midpoint (the index at which this occurs). 
      *otherwise, (elif) if the list[mindpoint] < target; if the element held at the midpoint is less than the target, discard all elements to the right of 
       the midpoint, these elements cannot possibly be the item as the target is less than the item at the midpoint. Update last to point to the index which is
       one less than the midpoint [last = midpoint - 1] 
       *After the while-loop, return None. If the while-loop does not return a particular index, the item is not contained within the list.

Question: Implement a function called binary_search which takes in a list and a target as parameters. Construct the function such that 
it returns the index of the specified target; if the target is not contained within the list, return None.  

def binary_search(list, target):
    first = 0
    last = len(list) - 1

    while first <= last:
        mid = (first + last) // 2
        if list[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif list[mid] < target:
            first = mid + 1
        else:
            last = mid - 1
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    list = [2,6, 3, 4, 1, 5]
    list.sort()
    result = binary_search(list, 5)
    print(str(result))
